# üèÜ Milestone Bot

A purpose‚Äëbuilt Discord bot for logging, displaying, and managing player **milestones** with Google Sheets as a structured, auditable backend.  
Designed for **self‚Äëservice**, **resilience**, and a **smooth user experience** ‚Äî with leaderboards, personal stats, autocomplete, and safe entry removal.

## üèóÔ∏è Design Decisions & Challenges

Decisions based on challenges encountered during development.

- **Autocomplete for Species**  
  **Challenge:** Discord slash commands limit static choice lists to 25 entries, but our species list exceeds that.  
  **Decision & Impact:** Replaced static `@choices` with an `@autocomplete` callback. This bypasses the cap, scales indefinitely, and improves UX with live filtering.

- **On-Ready Task Startup**  
  **Challenge:** Scheduled tasks (`@tasks.loop`) were starting before the event loop was ready, causing race-condition errors.  
  **Decision & Impact:** Moved task startup into `on_ready()` and added `.is_running()` guards. Tasks now launch only after the bot is fully synced.

- **String-Normalized IDs**  
  **Challenge:** Google Sheets sometimes returned numeric Discord IDs, while Discord.py uses strings, leading to mismatches.  
  **Decision & Impact:** Cast all IDs to strings before comparison. Ensures correct matching in stats retrieval and row deletion.

- **Precise Row Deletion**  
  **Challenge:** `delete_row`/`delete_rows` methods were inconsistently available on `Worksheet` objects.  
  **Decision & Impact:** Switched to spreadsheet-level `batch_update` with a `deleteDimension` request to reliably remove the exact row across all environments.

- **Rate-Limit Friendly Interactions**  
  **Challenge:** Using `defer()` plus `followup.send()` twice sometimes triggered Discord 429 errors.  
  **Decision & Impact:** Consolidated to a single `response.send_message()` call where possible, reducing HTTP calls and avoiding rate limits.

- **Self-Service & Transparency**  
  **Challenge:** Players needed a way to view and correct their own data without moderator help.  
  **Decision & Impact:** Added `/my_stats` for private stats breakdown and `/remove_milestone` with strict DiscordID + Species + Tier validation to safely remove entries.
